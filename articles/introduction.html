<p>In their 2007 book “<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-48572-0" class="external-link">The
illusion of certainty: Health Benefits and Risks</a>”, authors Erik
Rifkin and Edward Bouwer addressed a number of aspects related to the
communication of risk to individuals and broad audiences, arguing that
adequate communication of risk, including on the uncertainty embedded in
risk assessments, is fundamental to personal and collective
deliberations.</p>
<p>The book presents a number of interesting concepts (I suggest reading
<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387485706" class="external-link">the whole
book</a>, or go through some book reviews that summarise some of its key
points, e.g. this <a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/178/11/1512" class="external-link">book
review on CMAJ, the Canadian Medical Association Journal</a> or <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/abs/illusion-of-certainty-health-benefits-and-risks-by-erik-rifkin-and-edward-bouwer-guest-author-bob-sheff-new-york-springer-2007-244-pp-2995-8080420/6338DFBCCDF6A162004F53970A722A9E" class="external-link">this
one on the Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics</a>), but in this
post I will focus specifically on a type of visualisation proposed by
its authors: the risk characterisation theatre. The core idea is to take
a seating chart, such as the ones used for booking a place in a theatre,
and obscuring a share of seats corresponding to the risk. Here is an
image from their book, <a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/178/11/1512" class="external-link">as re-published by
CMAJ</a>.</p>
<div class="float">

<p>Knowing that this theatre has 1 000 seats, we get an idea of how
common the given adverse effect is. The visualisation is particularly
effective when two or more graphs are placed next to each other, one
showing baseline risk, the other the effect of treatment, or comparing
different risk scenarios.</p>
<p>This visualisation makes it possible to show relatively rare risks
that are often difficult to represent (anything smaller than a couple
percentage points would look negligible, e.g., in a pie chart, but
there’s a big difference between a 2 per cent risk and a 0.02 per cent
risk), allows to associate a risk with a quantity and context that a
person can instinctively relate to, and by not giving prominence to
exact figures, it implicitly deals with the big issue of uncertainty in
risk.</p>
<p>Overall, I feel there are clear merits for this type of
visualisations, and surely enough merit to deserve a modern graphical
implementation of this technique enabling its wider adoption, be it
among medical professionals or data journalists.</p>
<p>Before moving on to more examples and introducing our own
implementation of this concept, I will state the obvious: this
visualisation is effective in some cases, but not so much in others;
sometimes, we <em>do</em> have a very high degree of certainty in a
given data point; getting familiar with research data may be useful, but
context remains fundamental and consultation with professionals may be
necessary for a better interpretation of risk statististics (indeed, the
book is at least partly addressed to doctors seeking to present risk to
their own patients during such consultations).</p>

</h2>
<p>Solutions that share some of the features of the risk
characterisation theatre designed by Rifkin and Bouwer are not unseen in
data visualisation. For example, when showing the impact of “long Covid”
according to a recent study, the data team at <em>The Economist</em> <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/01/18/in-serious-cases-covid-19-symptoms-can-linger-for-a-long-time" class="external-link">showed
the frequency of different symptoms</a> by changing the shade of the
relevant share of dots out of a bunch of 100 dots: this shows relative
and absolute numbers, but somehow lacks the natural association with a
real world scenario that defines the risk characterisation theatre.
Instead of showing a bunch of dots, for example, they could have shown
them as places in a bus: if you imagine a typical bus with 50 places,
then a figure such as “22 per cent of patients discharged from hospital
after covid-19 reported hair loss” could be depicted as 11 individuals
on a bus full of people who have left hospital after receiving care for
covid-19: a situation that can easily be imagined by anyone familiar
with a bus. The data become immediately less abstract.</p>
<p>To facilitate producing this kind of graph, I have created a package
for the R programming language, <code>riskviewer</code>. It currently
offers two basic scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>one based on a typical configuration of many airplanes common in
European routes such as the <a href="https://www.airnewzealand.eu/seat-map-airbus-a320-168i" class="external-link">Airbus
A320</a> or the <a href="https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Ryanair/Ryanair_Boeing_737-800.php" class="external-link">Boeing
737</a>, with about 30 rows, 6 seats per row, and close to two hundreds
seats in total.</li>
<li>one inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_Arena" class="external-link">Verona Arena</a>, a
Roman amphitheatre still used for performances and concerts (here is the
<a href="https://www.arena.it/arena/it/pages/mappa-posti-prezzi-biglietti-arena-verona.html" class="external-link">official
seating chart</a>); in my implementation (not an accurate replica), the
Arena has approximately 10 000 seating places;</li>
</ul>
<p>Both settings should be relatively familiar to many in Europe, or at
least it should be easy for them to visually imagine the size of the
crowd involved. I see the advantage of choosing seating charts of
smaller size (such as buses), but it is not uncommon to be in the
position to represent relatively rare risks, whereby larger seat charts
can be more useful.</p>
<p>Let’s start from one of the examples Rifin and Bouwer outline in
their book: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Doctors_Study" class="external-link">the British
Doctors Study</a>, a 50 years long study that ran from 1951 to 2001 and
determined the increased risk of lung cancer associated with smoking
tobacco.</p>
<p>There are many ways to present these data, and many data points that
outline, for example, the relative benefits for those who quit smoking
earlier. But let’s just look at one of the most blunt data points: the
number of people who lived from age 35 through age 80. Among smokers, 74
per cent died before reaching the age of 80, compared to 41 per cent of
the non-smokers (figures relate to people born in the first decade of
the last century).</p>

<p>For people born in the early 20th century, it was not uncommon to die
before reaching the age of 80, as it appears by looking at the
“non-smokers” airplane. There are also quite a few people who smoked all
their life and happily reached the age of 80, as appears from looking at
the “smokers” flight. But the difference among the two airplanes is
still striking, and the metaphor here is perfectly fitting: by smoking
(or not smoking) you choose which plane you board on.</p>

<p>Last month, the data team at <em>The Economist</em> published a
characteristically excellent interactive visualisation that allows to
estimate the risk of hospitalisation and death for people diagnosed with
covid-19 in the United States, based on age, sex, and underlying medical
conditions. Do check out their <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/covid-pandemic-mortality-risk-estimator" class="external-link">risk
estimator</a> for more details.</p>
<p>How would the same data look when presented with our
<code>riskviewer</code>? For the sake of simplicity, I will not include
any comorbidity, and just present the risk of hospitalisation and death
for otherwise healthy individuals.</p>
<p>What is the risk, for example, for a healthy man and a healthy woman
aged 65 diagnosed with covid-19 in the United States?</p>

<p>Notice that in this graph there is no number: there is no easy way to
say an exact percentage for the relative risk. Does it matter? Does
knowing an exact number make my personal risk estimation more or less
meaningful than just by looking at this graph? In a risk estimate such
as this one there is a lot of uncertainty involved: does knowing that
the risk of death for males aged 65 diagnosed with covid-19 according to
this approach is estimated at 2.8 per cent make me any wiser about my
personal understanding of actual risk? This is a key way in which
uncertainty is implicitly embedded in this type of graph.</p>
<p>The graph shows clearly that men are noticeably more at risk than
women, that most people in this group will pass covid-19 without need
for hospitalisation, but also that the risk of hospitalisation is not so
rare. The more you phyisically imagine the actual situation of how many
people there are on an airplane, the more you will have internalised how
risky this situation is. Not in the abstract, but in real terms.</p>
<p>I will make a few more examples related to covid-19, but before
continuing I would like to reiterate two points: this graph shows
personal risk, and does not account for the additional risk that can be
caused by infecting others. As pointed out <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/01/18/in-serious-cases-covid-19-symptoms-can-linger-for-a-long-time" class="external-link">in
this other piece by <em>The Economist</em></a>, a large share of those
hospitalised for covid-19 still have a variety of symptoms months after
hospitalisation.</p>

<p>This visualisation based on airplanes makes sense for relatively
frequent events, i.e. events with a risk of at least about 1 per cent.
In their book, Rifkin and Bouwer show smaller risk by presenting
e.g. ten theatres, showing that only once every ten full theatres the
risk is likely to occur.</p>
<p>In our case, we will stick to planes, but make them more compact.</p>
<p>Let’s present the same type of information shown in the graph above,
but for people who are 20 years younger: aged 45, diagnosed with
covid-19 in the United States, with no recorded underlying
conditions.</p>

<p>As appears from the graph, the personal risk of otherwise healthy
males aged 45 diagnosed with covid-19 is certainly less scary, but still
not quite reassuring. In a crowd corresponding to the number of people
fitting on an airplane, the vast majority would not have severe
consequences, but we would always have someone who will need to be
hospitalised. Every couple of “flights”, we would have one dead. With
comorbidities, the graph becomes soon less reassuring.</p>
<p>If as a healthy 45-years old male you want to assess your personal
risk, you can picture yourself buying 10 plane tickets with a randomly
assigned seat in one of the flights above. How does it feel? The risk
will feel different to different people. But again, notice that not
knowing the exact percentage associated with a risk does not hinder our
capacity to properly assess risk. If anything, this visualisation pushes
us to rely on our “natural” risk assessment instincts, reducing the
distraction and illusion of certainty that would be associated with
something like “there’s a 0.2 per cent risk”.</p>
<p>I feel this kind of visualisation works best when it relates to an
active choice and when it shows both the absolute and the relative risk
reduction (such as in the case of smoking vs non-smoking, or with a
doctor and patient discussing a course of action), but I still think it
can be quite powerful in a wider range of cases.</p>

<p>Perhaps the main strength of the idea of risk characterisation
theatre is to show risk based on a number of individuals that can
conceivably be imagined by a person as a sum of individuals, rather than
as a crowd or big number such as “one million” that is beyond the human
experience. The idea of a risk that is as rare as, e.g., “one in a
million” is humanly difficult to conceive.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to present risks of the scale of one in a
thousand or even one in ten thousand using the risk characterisation
theatre?</p>
<p>Here is an attempt based on an imaginary arena with about 10 000
places. This may be similar in size to some concert venues, and depicts
a crowd that many of us have seen gathered together in real life.</p>

<p>Scenario A represents a risk of one in a thousand, scenario B a risk
of 5 in a thousand. The difference is clear, and perhaps we could still
show this to people who are less familiar with numbers and help them
understand relative risk. You could conceivably use this to illustrate
even a risk of one in a million: “imagine an arena with 10 000 people;
now, imagine 100 such arenas: one single person in this one hundred
arenas will suffer this adverse effect”. Perhaps this kind of narrated
data visualisation could be of use in the doctor-patient situation
imagined by Rifkin and Bouwer when they first conceived the risk
characterisation theatre.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this would eventually be quite similar to the kind of
visualisations that data journalists have used online with the
scrollytelling format. It may still be more effective than abstract
numbers in many cases. But it is already something different: the real
strength of the visualisation format outlined in this post is to bring
risk assessment to a size we can directly relate to and a measure where
our instinctive understandings of risk still work.</p>
